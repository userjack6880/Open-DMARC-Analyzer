# Support Levels

- **Full Support** means that software will recieve regular bug fixes, feature updates (if applicable), and security fixes. All current versions do not have an expected End of Support or End of Life date, as new version releases are not always predictable.

- **Critical Support** means that software will no longer recieve regular bug fixes or feature updates, but security fixes will still be provided.

- **End of Life** means that there is no more support what-so-ever. Issues, bug reports, and code contributions to these versions will be ignored or rejected.
